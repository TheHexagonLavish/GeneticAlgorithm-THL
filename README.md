<h3>Genetic algorithm for personal environments</h3>

<h3>Description:</h3>

This genetic algorithm is written in C++ and is part of the ongoing research project, <strong>PIR</strong>.
It was initially started in the Bloodshed IDE.

It is based on simple comparisons between individuals but I want the program to simulate a convergence of 
restricted mating sequences.
